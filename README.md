Getting Started
Before diving into the development process, ensure you have the necessary prerequisites and development environment set up.

Prerequisites
Node.js and npm: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org). npm (Node Package Manager) comes bundled with Node.js, so you don't need to install it separately.

Code Editor: Choose a code editor for writing and editing the project code. Popular options include Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Sublime Text. Ensure that your code editor is installed and properly configured.

Terminal or Command Prompt: You will need a terminal or command prompt to execute commands and run scripts. Most operating systems come with a default terminal, such as Terminal (macOS), Command Prompt (Windows), or Terminal (Linux). Make sure you can access the terminal or command prompt from your development environment.

Installation Steps
Clone the Repository: Clone the E-commerce Application repository from the project's repository URL using Git or download the ZIP file.

Navigate to the Project Directory: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the cloned or extracted project.

Install Dependencies: Run the following command to install the project dependencies using the command: npm install.

Environment Variables: If the application requires any environment variables, create a .env file in the project's root directory and provide the necessary variables. Refer to the project's documentation for any required environment variables.

Configuration: Depending on your specific requirements, configure any necessary files and settings, such as payment gateways or authentication systems.

Start the Development Server: To start the development server and run the Next.js application, use the command: npm run dev.

Verify the Installation: Once the development server is running, you should be able to access the E-commerce Application in your web browser. Test the features and functionality to ensure everything is working as expected.
